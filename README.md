The challenge to code at least one hour every day for the next 100 days.

Just a repository for members of BBT to share some of their little scripting projects. Let's see if we can get 100 days of code together!

## FAQ:

### What Is The #100DaysOfCode Challenge?

  100 Days Of Code is a social media project, primarily on Twitter, that anyone can participate in via the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. Developer Alex Kallaway started it in 2016 based   on the idea that consistency is the path to mastery. Plus, the hashtag fosters a sense of community—you can use it to see where others are at in their journey and to stay  motivated to document your own.

### How Can I Participate?

  Do #100DaysOfCode with Baltimore Black Techies! Work your way through projects, or document your Tech journey—either way, posting what you’re learning each day is a great way to see your coding progress unfold and find support. We’ll support you with encouraging messages along the way, and you’ll have the entire Baltimore Tech online community to supplement your interactions. At the end of your 100 days coding with us, you’ll get a host of experience and several friends that have taken part in this challenge.
